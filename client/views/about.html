  <h1 class="text-center">Welcome to my Profile</h1>

  <p>I am Kenyon Westbrook and welcome to my website! I am an up and coming Web Developer, over the last 2-3 years I have learned many technologies and languages, some of which you can find under the "Experience" Tab in the Navbar, I love coding, as the quote you found on the Home page puts it, a Programmer is in complete control of their own world, you can do anything, the only limit is your own knowledge. That is why I am always stiving to learn more and more, more frameworks, languages, methods of acheiving my goals in coding, needless to say the countless ways to acheive any specific goal in coding and countless different languages, technologies, frameworks, and even blocks of code to bring about the same result, that is what facinates me. The diversity in code and the seemingly endless possiblities to choose from. Sometimes it can get frustrating because no one can know it all, or can they, is it possible to be familiar with every coding language, framework, package, module ect... ect... Well after having listened to me, in your mind, rant on about my facination with code you probably want to know a little bit about me.

  <p>I was born and grew up in Pinetop-Lakeside, a small town in the White Mountains of Arizona. I have always been intrigued by technologies and computers in general, but unfortunately I did not get awakend to the coding and programming world until my late 20's, I feel like I missed so much, I could be so much farther along to reaching my goals. Although I am very gratful for the childhood that I had, instead of learning about programming I was chopping wood, or shoveling cinders, or moving rocks or many other chores I was given. It was hard but I am gratful for the lessons I was taught from learning how to work hard and being persistent, Thank you Dad</p></br>
  <p>I am 32 years old and happily married with 2 children. If I have learned anything from being a father it is "Patience", boy does my daughter teach me that one. I love her so much but as I am sure you are aware 2-3 year olds are extremely stuborn, hahaha. I am very excited to see what kind of woman she will grow up to be, she will abviously know how to code.</p></br>
  <p>Plans for my future, I am taking the steps to earn my B.S. in Computer Science, it is very exciting and nerve racking as I know it will take a lot of time and dedication, the dedication I have the time not so much. Nevertheless I will reach my goal and earn my Bachelors Degree.</p>
  <p>Thank you for taking the time to read and get to know me a little better, if you have any questions please feel free to ask me.</p>
